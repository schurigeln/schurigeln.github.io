When using our App, we do not require you to provide us with any personally identifiable information. The only data we collect is the files you choose to convert using our App. We do not store, share, or transmit any of your files or their contents outside of the App. The files are processed locally on your device, and all conversion data is deleted as soon as the conversion is completed.

## 2. Use of Third-Party Libraries

The App uses the following third-party libraries to provide some of its features:

Please note that these libraries are included within the App and do not transmit any data to their respective developers or third parties.

## 3. Log Data

We do not collect any log data from the App. All actions and processes performed by the App are executed locally on your device.
